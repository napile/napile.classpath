 * The <code>ProcessingInstruction</code> interface represents a "processing

 * it is therefore possible to have the character sequence
 * <code>"?&gt;"</code> in the content, which is illegal a processing
 * instruction per section 2.6 of [<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204'>XML 1.0</a>]. The
 * presence of this character sequence must generate a fatal error during
