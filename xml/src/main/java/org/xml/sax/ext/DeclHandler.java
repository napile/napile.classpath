/**
 * SAX2 extension handler for DTD declaration events.
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <em>This module, both source code and documentation, is in the
 * Public Domain, and comes with <strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>.</em>
 * See <a href='http://www.saxproject.org'>http://www.saxproject.org</a>
 * for further information.
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>This is an optional extension handler for SAX2 to provide more
 * complete information about DTD declarations in an XML document.
 * XML readers are not required to recognize this handler, and it
 * is not part of core-only SAX2 distributions.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that data-related DTD declarations (unparsed entities and
 * notations) are already reported through the {@link
 * org.xml.sax.DTDHandler DTDHandler} interface.</p>
 *
 * <p>If you are using the declaration handler together with a lexical
 * handler, all of the events will occur between the
 * {@link org.xml.sax.ext.LexicalHandler#startDTD startDTD} and the
 * {@link org.xml.sax.ext.LexicalHandler#endDTD endDTD} events.</p>
 *
 * <p>To set the DeclHandler for an XML reader, use the
 * {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader#setProperty setProperty} method
 * with the property name
 * <code>http://xml.org/sax/properties/declaration-handler</code>
 * and an object implementing this interface (or null) as the value.
 * If the reader does not report declaration events, it will throw a
 * {@link org.xml.sax.SAXNotRecognizedException SAXNotRecognizedException}
 * when you attempt to register the handler.</p>
