/**
 * The <code>XPathNamespace</code> interface is returned by
 * <code>XPathResult</code> interfaces to represent the XPath namespace node
 * type that DOM lacks. There is no public constructor for this node type.
 * Attempts to place it into a hierarchy or a NamedNodeMap result in a
 * <code>DOMException</code> with the code <code>HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR</code>
 * . This node is read only, so methods or setting of attributes that would
 * mutate the node result in a DOMException with the code
 * <code>NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR</code>.
 * <p>The core specification describes attributes of the <code>Node</code>
 * interface that are different for different node node types but does not
 * describe <code>XPATH_NAMESPACE_NODE</code>, so here is a description of
 * those attributes for this node type. All attributes of <code>Node</code>
 * not described in this section have a <code>null</code> or
 * <code>false</code> value.
 * <p><code>ownerDocument</code> matches the <code>ownerDocument</code> of the
 * <code>ownerElement</code> even if the element is later adopted.
 * <p><code>prefix</code> is the prefix of the namespace represented by the
 * node.
 * <p><code>nodeName</code> is the same as <code>prefix</code>.
 * <p><code>nodeType</code> is equal to <code>XPATH_NAMESPACE_NODE</code>.
 * <p><code>namespaceURI</code> is the namespace URI of the namespace
 * represented by the node.
 * <p><code>adoptNode</code>, <code>cloneNode</code>, and
 * <code>importNode</code> fail on this node type by raising a
 * <code>DOMException</code> with the code <code>NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR</code>.In
 * future versions of the XPath specification, the definition of a namespace
 * node may be changed incomatibly, in which case incompatible changes to
 * field values may be required to implement versions beyond XPath 1.0.
 * <p>See also the <a href='http://www.w3.org/2002/08/WD-DOM-Level-3-XPath-20020820'>Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 XPath Specification</a>.
