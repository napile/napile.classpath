/**
 * Interface for an element's attribute specifications.
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <em>This module, both source code and documentation, is in the
 * Public Domain, and comes with <strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>.</em>
 * See <a href='http://www.saxproject.org'>http://www.saxproject.org</a>
 * for further information.
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>This is the original SAX1 interface for reporting an element's
 * attributes.  Unlike the new {@link org.xml.sax.Attributes Attributes}
 * interface, it does not support Namespace-related information.</p>
 *
 * <p>When an attribute list is supplied as part of a
 * {@link org.xml.sax.DocumentHandler#startElement startElement}
 * event, the list will return valid results only during the
 * scope of the event; once the event handler returns control
 * to the parser, the attribute list is invalid.  To save a
 * persistent copy of the attribute list, use the SAX1
 * {@link org.xml.sax.helpers.AttributeListImpl AttributeListImpl}
 * helper class.</p>
 *
 * <p>An attribute list includes only attributes that have been
 * specified or defaulted: #IMPLIED attributes will not be included.</p>
 *
 * <p>There are two ways for the SAX application to obtain information
 * from the AttributeList.  First, it can iterate through the entire
 * list:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public void startElement (String name, AttributeList atts) {
 *   for (int i = 0; i < atts.getLength(); i++) {
 *     String name = atts.getName(i);
 *     String type = atts.getType(i);
 *     String value = atts.getValue(i);
 *     [...]
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>(Note that the result of getLength() will be zero if there
 * are no attributes.)
 *
 * <p>As an alternative, the application can request the value or
 * type of specific attributes:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public void startElement (String name, AttributeList atts) {
 *   String identifier = atts.getValue("id");
 *   String label = atts.getValue("label");
 *   [...]
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @deprecated This interface has been replaced by the SAX2
 *             {@link org.xml.sax.Attributes Attributes}
 *             interface, which includes Namespace support.
 * @since SAX 1.0
 * @author David Megginson
 * @version 2.0.1 (sax2r2)
 * @see org.xml.sax.DocumentHandler#startElement startElement
 * @see org.xml.sax.helpers.AttributeListImpl AttributeListImpl
